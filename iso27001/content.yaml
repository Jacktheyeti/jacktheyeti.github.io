    title: "Situation"
    paragraphs:
      - heading: "Context"
        body: "Following an acquisition, I stepped into an ongoing ISO 27001:2022 initiative that had been active for 12 months."
      - heading: "The Friction"
        body: "Despite a year of effort, the project was stalled. The team was siloed, frustrated, and suffering from compliance fatigue."
      - heading: "The Root Cause"
        body: "The initiative was being led by DevOps engineers — highly technical talent that was bogged down by the administrative weight of ISO requirements, lacking the project management structure to make efficient progress."
      - heading: "Personal Constraint"
        body: 'As the "new guy" post-acquisition, I had no initial social capital and needed to learn the specific ISO 27001:2022 framework rapidly while building trust.'

  - id: task
    title: "Task"
    paragraphs:
      - heading: "The Mandate"
        body: "Unblock the stalled ISO 27001 certification effort and operationalize a functioning Information Security Management System (ISMS) — without formal authority or pre-existing relationships."
      - heading: "The Constraint"
        body: "Bridge two fundamentally different cultures — fast-moving DevOps and methodical audit governance — while earning the trust of a frustrated team that had been spinning for a year."

  - id: action
    title: "Action"
    paragraphs:
      - heading: "Phase 1 — Observation & Empathy"
        body: "Instead of asserting immediate authority, I joined calls strictly to listen. I identified that the engineers viewed compliance as an obstruction rather than a process."
      - heading: "Phase 2 — Value-First Leadership"
        body: 'I bridged the gap between "DevOps culture" and "Audit requirements." I introduced lightweight Project Management (PM) principles to de-conflict their schedules.'
      - heading: "Key Win"
        body: "I didn't tell them what to do; I helped them organize how they did it. This bought me the trust required to lead."
        highlight: true
      - heading: "Phase 3 — Operationalizing the PDCA Cycle"
        body: "Once trust was established, I took ownership of the program. We moved from theoretical discussions to implementing key controls and scheduling internal audits, effectively jumpstarting the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle required by the standard."

  - id: result
    title: "Result"
    paragraphs:
      - heading: "The Metric"
        body: "In just a few months, the team achieved more tangible progress on controls and audit readiness than in the previous year combined."
      - heading: "The Pivot"
        body: "Ultimately, business priorities shifted, and the executive team halted the certification pursuit."
      - heading: "The Takeaway"
        body: "While the badge was not achieved, the capability was built. I successfully transformed a frustrated, stalled engineering cohort into a cohesive unit capable of executing complex governance frameworks. We proved that security governance doesn't have to be the enemy of engineering velocity."
