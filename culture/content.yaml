sections:
  - id: challenge
    phase: "01"
    title: 'The Challenge: The "Name and Blame" Trap'
    paragraphs:
      - heading: "The Toxic Norm"
        body: 'The IT and DevOps teams operated under a legacy culture of "Name and Blame." They were viewed as the "Department of No" — dismissive, impatient, and often hostile to end-users who made mistakes.'
      - heading: "The Consequence"
        body: 'This friction caused a dangerous silence. Users were terrified to report errors or ask questions, leading to "Shadow IT" and suppressed incident reporting.'
      - heading: "The Goal"
        body: 'To transform the security function from a punitive "policing" body into a supportive "consulting" partner.'

  - id: intervention
    phase: "02"
    title: "The Intervention: Leading with Radical Empathy"
    paragraphs:
      - heading: "Modeling Vulnerability"
        body: 'I realized that culture flows from the top. I stopped defending broken processes and started "owning" them. When things went wrong, I approached the team with curiosity ("How can I serve you better?") rather than judgment.'
      - heading: 'The "Litmus Test" (The Phishing Incident)'
        body: 'The true test came during a compromised email incident where a user reported the breach a week late due to fear of retribution.'
      - heading: "The Response"
        body: 'Instead of the typical "irate IT" response, I guided the senior engineers to respond with grace. We normalized the error ("It happens to everyone") and framed the late reporting as a learning opportunity, not a punishable offense. We thanked the user for coming forward at all.'

  - id: outcome
    phase: "03"
    title: 'The Outcome: From "Policing" to "Partnership"'
    paragraphs:
      - heading: "Behavioral Shift"
        body: "The technical team successfully de-escalated a critical incident without alienation. The user became an advocate rather than a victim."
      - heading: 'The "Knock on the Door" Metric'
        body: 'The most significant win is the shift in engagement. We are no longer just receiving "incident reports" (reactive); we are now fielding "consultation requests" (proactive).'
      - heading: "The Legacy"
        body: "Employees now approach the security team before they act — asking for advice on data deletion or tool selection — proving that we successfully replaced fear with trust."
